# Feature Status

## Implemented Features
- The system should be able to run both on the companyâ€™s data centers but also locally by developers on their machines. One of the issues we have with our current CI/CD is that we cannot run workflows either in part or in full locally to assist with development and debugging.
- For the definition of pipelines
  - we want to have the same organization as other CI/CD, stages and jobs
  - all jobs and stages must be able to run inside Docker containers
  - we must be able to define multiple pipelines for a repository and the definitions should follow the DRY principle
  - jobs and stages must be named and we should be able to refer to these names in the CLI and in the description
  - we must be able to specify the order of stages
  - we must be able to specify the order of jobs within a stage
  - all jobs in a stage should be run in parallel unless we specify dependencies between jobs

- the CLI must be able to validate a configuration and provide helpful error messages
